why does terraform destroy not think the role was deleted
	it is in the console
	something about policies


install.sh should replace the bucketname in provider.tf with one that isn't mine and create the bucket

better name for install.sh
	probably break into multiple scripts so people can only install what they need
	people so picky about their pip install locations jeeze

make it work - ec2 starts up but server doesnt run/wont accept connections

make the ec2 private with no ip
	setting it to private in terraform doesnt work unless the subnets are setup to not autoassign a public ip address
	so do that.  probably in a script.  so we can share it

cloudwatch logging? do i care about money
	s3 logging oooo
	maybe i can toggle it on or off
	seperate terraform folder?
	Can I email the alerts to tati and make her deal with it?

script to create user with permissions to run only terraform/ssm(when it exists)

ssm access for ec2 so you dont have to use ssh
	make the ec2 private

does minecraft do passwords?

ec2 shouldnt have access to all of the s3 things

convert to terragrunt so we can destroy one thing at a time
	also multiple servers

look into price of having a custom url
	idontdowellunderpressurechristian.com
	is that too long?
	probably really cheap

some sort of way to easily change the preferences for the server
could probably do a single page application served out of s3 with a lambda or something that yoinks information from s3
	w h a t if the lambda ran terraform
	and it could spin servers up and down
	the ec2 could serve the app
	and then it could just kill the old server


can i email myself spend information?

upgrade to micro
	Looks like its crashing on a nano right after startup

cloudwatch alert for when ec2 security updates are available.
	super low priority
	we can also just terminate the instance once a week and i think it'll pick up minor patches
	i dont think ami updates happen that oftend
